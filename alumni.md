Community Agreement
===================

The remit of this agreement is to foster a strong community that is self organising and durable.

###Overview
A critical part of Enspiral Dev Academy is the community developing around it. The academy forms the hub of the community. There are several aspects to this: 

1. Physically - its physical location.
2. Culturally - the culture we share.
3. Socially - through activities and events.
4. Common Experience - those who attend the academy (staff or student)

Trying to define a community can be seen as logically reductive process, this poses several challenges including being very brittle to change. This agreement follows an additive approach, instead of defining all the possible interactions the community can have through EDA. It defines a base sentiment and suggests some possible interactions. This empowers the community to self organise and develop interactions as needed.

##The Parties

###Enspiral Dev Academy

The process for creating an agreement is quite straightforward

1. Create a document with the word [draft] in the title and make it publicly editable.
1. Create a new Loomio in the general Enspiral group and allow at least a week for discussion.
1. Change the  permissions to comment only and create a proposal to formally accept the agreement.
1. Once the proposal passes remove the word draft, put in a link to the loomio discussion and the date it was passed and drop it in the Agreements Folder and update the Enspiral Overview doc with a short description.
