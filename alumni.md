Community Agreement
===================

The remit of this agreement is to foster a strong community that is self organising and durable.

###Overview
A critical part of Enspiral Dev Academy is the community developing around it. The academy forms the hub of the community. There are several aspects to this: 

1. Physically - its physical location.
2. Culturally - the culture we share.
3. Socially - through activities and events.
4. Common Experience - those who attend the academy (staff or student)

Trying to define a community can be seen as a logically reductive process, this poses several challenges including the cognitive model being very brittle to change. This agreement follows an additive approach, instead of defining all the possible interactions the community can have through EDA. It defines a base sentiment and suggests some possible interactions. This empowers the community to self organise and develop interactions as needed.

##Gift Economy
To facilitate a self organising system we will cultivate a gifting economy where either of the parties may gift to the other. There are no strings attached and the gift transaction occurs as a result of both parties being happy with the transaction.

Transactions can be proposed by either party, it will then be explored and planned as needed.

Through having a gift economy each person in the EDA community will be empowered to pitch their idea for a community activity to others. This will create a diverse range of activities and allow community members to do what they enjoy and want to work on.


###Suggested Gifts
1. Alumni coaches a current student 1 on 1.
2. Alumni supports the floor for a day.
3. Alumni receives mentoring.
4. Alumni gives a seminar.
5. Alumni uses an EDA desk.

###Notes on Desks
Desk space is a finite resource at EDA, as such when supply runs short EDA will facilitate sharing of the Alumni desk space through a booking system. Priority will be given to the most recent graduating students as they work through careers week and start looking for work.
