#Enspiral Dev Academy Mission

##Exquisite Livelihoods
For far too many people work is something to endure which does not allow them to express their fullest potential. We are passionate about helping people create exquisite livelihoods which are interesting, challenging, well paid and add real value to society.

##Tech as the leading export of New Zealand
If tech were our leading export it would make a big difference to the country's economy as well as our social and environmental issues. Lack of talent is the biggest barrier to growing the ICT sector and we exist to remove that barrier. 

##Transform our education system
To be competitive as a country we need a first class education system which is a far cry from where we are currently. Like our employment partners our core business is innovation and we want to catalyse a wider movement in New Zealand which applies technology, design thinking and entrepreneurship to create education options fit for the 21st century.

##Population parity in our industry
The NZ tech sector has a poor track record of diversity and some of the best potential programmers in the country are being left on the sidelines. We are committed to helping people from diverse backgrounds join the tech community and aim for the demographics of our industry to match those of New Zealand.
